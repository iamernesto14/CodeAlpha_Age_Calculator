1. Initialize the Application
   - Create HTML with input fields for day, month, and year
   - Add a submit button
   - Add placeholders to display the results

2. Capture User Input
   - On submit button click event:
     - Get the value of the 'day' input field
     - Get the value of the 'month' input field
     - Get the value of the 'year' input field

3. Validate User Input
   - If 'day' is empty, show "Day is required"
   - If 'month' is empty, show "Month is required"
   - If 'year' is empty, show "Year is required"
   - Check if 'day' is between 1 and 31
   - Check if 'month' is between 1 and 12

4. Calculate the Age
   - Get the current date (currentDay, currentMonth, currentYear)
   - Calculate age in years, months, and days:
     - ageYears = currentYear - year
     - ageMonths = currentMonth - month
     - ageDays = currentDay - day
   - Adjust for cases where the day and month of the birth date haven't occurred yet in the current year:
     - If ageMonths < 0, decrease ageYears by 1 and increase ageMonths by 12
     - If ageDays < 0, adjust the previous monthâ€™s days and correct ageDays and ageMonths

5. Display the Result
   - Update the HTML placeholders with:
     - Calculated years
     - Calculated months
     - Calculated days

6. Handle Errors and Edge Cases
   - Check for invalid dates (e.g., February 30)
   - Provide feedback for invalid input values
   - Consider leap years when adjusting days and months
